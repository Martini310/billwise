# BillWise

Billwise is my first fullstack project in Django Rest Framework, NextJS and Celery. 

## Readme in progress
Full Readme will be available after finished the app. I want to deploy app on Heroku or something simmilar and create a Docker Image to make your own enviroment fast and easy.

## Features
Main features for now:
- Payments synchronized with major platforms in Poland (*PGNiG, Enea, Aquanet*)
- Yearly summary with monthly chart and y2y comparission
- Newest/Nearest Payment
- Payment Percentage
- Month summary with m2m comparission
- Add own invoices manually
- and many small details that required a lot of work and education

Plans:
- Email notifications
- Payments directly from app
- Many more suppliers (*Inea, Orange, Tmobile etc.*)
- Dark mode
